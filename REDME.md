# M5StickCPlus Multi-Screen Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating different strategies for managing multiple screens on an M5StickCPlus (ESP32) device. The examples are organized into separate folders, each exploring a particular strategy.

## Strategies

### Finite State Machine (FSM)

The Finite State Machine (FSM) example demonstrates the use of an FSM to manage multiple screens on an M5StickCPlus device. The code includes three different screens that the user can switch between by pressing any of the buttons on the device.

To learn more and get started with the FSM example, check the [README](FSM/README.md) file in the `FSM` folder.

## Getting Started

1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) on your computer.
2. Install the [M5StickCPlus](https://github.com/m5stack/M5StickC-Plus) library using the Arduino Library Manager.
3. Clone or download this repository.
4. Open the desired example `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
